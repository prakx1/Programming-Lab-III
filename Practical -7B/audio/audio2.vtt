00:00:34.718 --> 00:00:39.017
′Cause sometimes you just feel
tired‚ you feel weak

00:00:39.217 --> 00:00:43.716
And when you feel weak you feel
like you want to just give up

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.399
But you gotta search within you‚ you
gotta find that inner strength

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:51.598
And just pull that shit out
of you and get that motivation
to not give up

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:56.301
And not be a quitter‚ no matter how
bad you want to just fall flat
on your face and collapse

00:00:56.505 --> 00:00:59.004
′Til I collapse I am spilling these
raps long as you feel them

00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:02.201
′Til the day that I drop you′ll never
say that I am not killing them

00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:04.800
′Cause when I am not then I
am a stop pinning them

00:01:05.018 --> 00:01:08.017
And I am not hip hop and
I am just not Eminem

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.518
Subliminal thoughts when
I am stop sending them

00:01:10.714 --> 00:01:13.113
Women are caught in webs
spin and hock venom

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.798
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could
not get the illin′ to stop

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.999
Amoxicillin is just not real enough

00:01:19.215 --> 00:01:21.614
The criminal cop killing
hip hop filling a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.499
Minimal swap to cop millions
of Pac listeners

00:01:24.707 --> 00:01:26.706
You are coming with me‚ feel it or not

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.399
You are gona fear it like I showed you
the spirit of god lives in us

00:01:30.607 --> 00:01:33.406
You hear it a lot‚ lyrics that
shock‚ is it a miracle

00:01:33.612 --> 00:01:36.011
Or am I just a product
of pop fizzing up

00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:38.700
For shizzle my whizzle this
is the plot listen up

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.499
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle
does not give a fuck

00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:43.704
′Til the roof comes off‚
till the lights go out

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.499
′Til my legs give out‚
can′t shut my mouth

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.308
′Til the smoke clears out
and my high perhaps

00:01:49.506 --> 00:01:52.105
I am a rip this shit till
my bone collapse

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:54.908
′Til the roof comes off‚
till the lights go out

00:01:55.108 --> 00:01:57.707
′Til my legs give out‚
can′t shut my mouth

00:01:57.903 --> 00:02:00.602
′Til the smoke clears out
and my high perhaps

00:02:00.806 --> 00:02:03.305
I am a rip this shit till
my bone collapse

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:06.198
Music is like magic there′s
a certain feeling you get

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:08.917
When You are real and you spit and
people are feeling your shit

00:02:09.103 --> 00:02:11.802
This is your moment and every
single minute you spittin′

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.499
Trying to hold onto it ′cause
you may never get it again

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:17.300
So while You are in it try to
get as much shit as you can

00:02:17.502 --> 00:02:20.001
And when your run is over just admit
when It is at it is end

00:02:20.217 --> 00:02:22.916
′Cause I am at the end of my wit is
with half the shit that gets in

00:02:23.112 --> 00:02:25.911
I got a list‚ here′s the order
of my list that It is in

00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:28.610
It goes‚ Reggie‚ Jay Z‚
Tupac and Biggie

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.309
Andre from Outkast‚ Jada‚
Kurupt‚ Nas and then me

00:02:31.507 --> 00:02:34.006
But in this industry I am the
cause of a lot of envy

00:02:34.212 --> 00:02:36.911
So when I am not put on this list
the shit does not offend me

00:02:37.103 --> 00:02:39.802
That′s why you see me walk around
like nothing′s bothering me

00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:42.905
Even though half you people got
a fuckin problem with me

00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:45.402
You hate it but you know respect
You have got to give me

00:02:45.608 --> 00:02:48.307
The press′s wet dream like Bobby
and Whitney‚ Nate hit me

00:02:48.517 --> 00:02:50.916
′Til the roof comes off‚
till the lights go out

00:02:51.112 --> 00:02:53.711
′Til my legs give out‚
can′t shut my mouth

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:56.506
′Til the smoke clears out
and my high perhaps

00:02:56.704 --> 00:02:59.503
I am a rip this shit till
my bone collapse

00:02:59.703 --> 00:03:02.102
′Til the roof comes off‚
till the lights go out

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:04.915
′Til my legs give out‚
can′t shut my mouth

00:03:05.103 --> 00:03:07.702
′Til the smoke clears out
and my high perhaps

00:03:07.916 --> 00:03:10.515
I am a rip this shit till
my bone collapse

00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:13.310
Soon as a verse starts I
eat at an MC′s heart

00:03:13.514 --> 00:03:16.113
What is he thinking? Enough to
not go against me‚ smart

00:03:16.311 --> 00:03:18.710
And it is absurd how people
hang on every word

00:03:18.916 --> 00:03:21.715
I will probably never get the
props I feel I ever deserve

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.508
But I will never be served my
spot is forever reserved

00:03:24.712 --> 00:03:27.311
If I ever leave earth that would
be the death of me first

00:03:27.511 --> 00:03:30.110
′Cause in my heart of hearts I know
nothing could ever be worse

00:03:30.316 --> 00:03:32.915
That′s why I am clever when I
put together every verse

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:35.918
My thoughts are sporadic‚ I
act like I am an addict

00:03:36.114 --> 00:03:38.613
I rap like I am addicted to smack
like I am Kim Mathers

00:03:38.817 --> 00:03:41.516
But I don′t want to go forth and
back in constant battles

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.399
The fact is I would rather sit
back and bomb some rappers′

00:03:44.611 --> 00:03:47.110
So this is like a full blown attack
I am launching at them

00:03:47.318 --> 00:03:50.117
The track is on some battling
raps who want some static

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.718
′Cause I don′t really think that the
fact that I am Slim matters

00:03:52.912 --> 00:03:55.611
A plaque of platinum status is whack
if I am not the baddest

00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:58.200
′Til the roof comes off‚
till the lights go out

00:03:58.412 --> 00:04:00.911
′Til my legs give out‚
can′t shut my mouth

00:04:01.107 --> 00:04:03.706
′Til the smoke clears out
and my high perhaps

00:04:03.916 --> 00:04:06.515
I am a rip this shit till
my bone collapse

00:04:06.703 --> 00:04:09.302
′Til the roof comes off‚
till the lights go out

00:04:09.508 --> 00:04:12.107
′Til my legs give out‚
can′t shut my mouth

00:04:12.315 --> 00:04:14.914
′Til the smoke clears out
and my high perhaps

00:04:15.118 --> 00:04:18.417
I am a rip this shit till
my bone collapse

00:04:18.615 --> 00:04:21.014
Until the roof (Until the roof)

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.999
The roof comes off (The
roof comes off)

00:04:24.207 --> 00:04:25.606
Until my legs (Until my legs)

00:04:25.818 --> 00:04:31.417
Give out from underneath
me (Underneath me‚ I)

00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:33.800
I will not fall

00:04:34.018 --> 00:04:36.517
I will stand tall

00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:41.700
Feels like no one can beat me

00:04:42.702 --> 00:04:51.701
