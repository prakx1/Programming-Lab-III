00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.960
since we'll talk a lot about the brain

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.000
today do you think

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.839
let's ask the craziest question do you

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:09.519
think there is other intelligent life

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:10.240
out there in the

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.960
universe honestly i've been asking

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.719
myself lately if there's intelligent

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.640
life on this planet

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.400
uh you know i ha i i have to

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.519
think probabilities suggest yes and

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.400
also secretly i think i just hope that's

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.880
true

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.840
it would be really um i know scientists

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.519
aren't supposed to have hopes and dreams

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:32.399
but uh

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.280
i i think it would be really cool and i

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.160
also

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.920
think it would be really sad if it if it

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.079
wasn't the case if we really were alone

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.079
that would be

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.440
that that would seem

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.920
profoundly sad i think so it's exciting

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.000
to you not scary

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.879
yeah no you know i take a lot of comfort

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.640
and curiosity

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.960
it's a great it's a great um

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.480
resource for dealing with uh stress

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.240
so i'm learning all about mushrooms and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.560
octopuses and you know all kinds of

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.760
stuff

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.720
and so for me this counts i think in the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.680
realm of awe

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.320
but also i think i'm somebody who

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.520
cultivates awe

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.360
deliberately on purpose to feel like a

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.880
speck you know

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.920
i i find it a relief

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.479
occasionally it feels small to feel

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:27.040
small

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.840
in a profoundly large and interesting

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.840
universe

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.640
you
