        <dt>Open-source</dt>
        <dd>
          Open-source software is a type of computer software in which source
          code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants
          users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software to
          anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be developed in a
          collaborative public manner.
        </dd>
        <dt>Object-oriented Language</dt>
        <dd>
          Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the
          concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the
          form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of
          objects is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify
          the data fields of itself.
        </dd>
        <dt>GUI</dt>
        <dd>
          A graphical user interface (GUI) allows a user to interact with a
          computer program using a pointing device that manipulates small
          pictures on a computer screen.
        </dd>
        <dt>High-level language</dt>
        <dd>
          A high-level programming language is a programming language with
          strong abstraction from the details of the computer. In contrast to
          low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements,
          be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant
          areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the
          process of developing a program simpler and more understandable than
          when using a lower-level language.
        </dd>
        <dt>dynamic Programming Language</dt>
        <dd>
          A dynamic programming language is a class of high-level programming
          languages, which at runtime execute many common programming behaviours
          that static programming languages perform during compilation.
